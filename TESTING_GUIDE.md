## Patient Edit with File Upload - Testing Guide

### Test Scenario: Adding Lab Results with File Upload

1. **Navigate to Patient Edit**
   - Go to: `/hospital/patient-edit/HP12345`
   - This should load the mock patient "John Doe"

2. **Test Lab Results Tab**
   - Click on the "Lab Results" tab
   - Click "Add Lab Result" button
   - This should open the AddRecordModal

3. **Test File Upload in Modal**
   - Fill in required fields:
     - Test Name: "Blood Test"
     - Test Date: Today's date
     - Results: "Normal"
   - Click "Upload Files" button
   - Select a PDF or image file
   - Verify file appears in the uploaded files list
   - Click "Add Record"

4. **Test Save Changes**
   - After adding the lab result, click "Save Changes"
   - Verify success message appears
   - Check that the lab result displays with attached files

5. **Test File Display and Document Modal**
   - Verify that uploaded files show with:
     - File name and size
     - "View" and "Download" buttons
     - Proper file icons
   - Click "View" button on an attachment
   - Verify that a modal popup opens displaying the document (PDF/image)
   - Test modal close functionality

6. **Test Patient Portal Synchronization**
   - After making changes in hospital portal, test patient portal:
   - Login to patient portal with:
     - Health Passport ID: `HP12345`
     - Password: `test123` or `password`
   - Navigate to different patient portal sections:
     - Dashboard (`/patient/dashboard`)
     - Medical History (`/patient/medical-history`)
     - Documents (`/patient/documents`)
     - Medications (`/patient/medications`)
     - Vitals (`/patient/vitals`)
     - Visits (`/patient/visits`)
     - Profile (`/patient/profile`)
     - Health Overview (`/patient/health-overview`)
   - Verify that all updates made in hospital portal are visible in patient portal

### Expected Behavior:
- Files should upload to Cloudinary
- Lab results should save with attachment references
- Files should be viewable in modal popup (not redirect to new tab)
- All changes should persist in the mock data store
- Patient portal should show updated data immediately after hospital portal changes

### Testing the Document Modal:
1. **Navigate to Patient Details**
   - Go to: `/hospital/patient-details/HP12345`
   - Click on the "Lab Results" tab
   
2. **Test Document Viewing**
   - Look for lab results with attached documents
   - Click the eye icon (View button) on any attachment
   - Verify that the document opens in a modal popup on the same page
   - For images: Should display the image directly
   - For PDFs: Should show an embedded PDF viewer
   - For other files: Should show download/open options
   
3. **Test Modal Features**
   - Verify the modal has a proper title with the document name
   - Test the "X" button to close the modal
   - Test the "Open in New Tab" button in the modal footer
   - Test the "Download" button in the modal footer
   - Verify clicking outside the modal closes it

### Testing Notes:
- Uses mock patient data (HP12345 - John Doe)
- Files uploaded to Cloudinary with proper error handling
- In-memory storage for testing (mock data updates)
- Hospital patient record access is persistent (no time limits)
- Full end-to-end functionality implemented
- **Document modal displays without page redirects**

### Implementation Status:
✅ File upload component in AddRecordModal
✅ File upload API endpoint (/api/upload)  
✅ File display in lab results section
✅ Backend API for patient CRUD operations
✅ Mock data integration for testing
✅ Cloudinary integration for file storage
✅ All 24-hour access restrictions removed from hospital patient records
✅ **Document viewing modal popup for lab result attachments**
✅ **Support for images, PDFs, and other file types in modal**
✅ **Modal provides download and external viewing options**
